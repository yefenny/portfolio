                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Since 12 years old I was interested in programming. I tried to learn some free pascal on my own
                    with some resources that I found online. Three years later, I went to college in the Dominican
                    Republic and in 2018 graduated from System in engineer. While in college my favorites subjects
                    were the ones where I had to solve logic problems and I had to find optimal solutions.</p>
                <p>Once learned the basics of some programming languages on my own and by some college's classes. I
                    decided to enroll in thinkful Engineering immersion to get quality guidance on how to start my
                    career as a Sofware developer, learn how to keep up with new technologies, and how to code
                    collaborating with other developers.</p>
                <p>Besides programming, I'm interested in mathematics although I'm very far from being a
                    mathematician. I also like fitness and learning how to stay healthy and in shape. </p>
